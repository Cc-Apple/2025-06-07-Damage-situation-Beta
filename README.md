2025-06-06 — Established Facts: This repo preserves chain-of-custody (SHA-256, UTC+7) and a dedicated space for June-06 artifacts; no event for 06-06 is confirmed in this note. Hypotheses: By analogy with 2025-06-07, a MyViettel-anchored co-occurrence window may exist on 06-06; same-second clusters (score=3) are the first verification target.
2025-06-06 — Consolidated Note.
Established Facts: (1) The repository maintains an auditable chain-of-custody (SHA-256 for source and derived files) with timestamps normalized to UTC+7. (2) A dedicated directory exists for 2025-06-06 to store artifacts, CSVs, and digest files; these slots are prepared for publication on GitHub. (3) Methods to be applied on 06-06 are pre-defined: 40-step text FUKABORI, category keyword scan, time-window joins (same-second/±60s/±5m), and human-impact mapping. Hypotheses (explicit): (A) Given the 2025-06-07 pattern, 06-06 may also contain a MyViettel-anchored co-occurrence; (B) if present, same-second clusters (time_score=3) should form the primary signal, with ±5-minute neighbors as supporting context; (C) Flame-related hits (Microsoft/Meta/Telco) could appear sparsely and must be labeled as hypotheses until confirmed by log refs and hashes. Next Actions: publish 06-06 artifacts to the prepared folder; run the standard pipeline; mark every statement as Established Fact only when backed by file path + SHA-256 + timestamp.
Add logs
On June 7, 2025 at 20:27:26, a new bug_type=210 crash was confirmed on iPhone12 mini-1. This is not a duplicate but a unique incident_id, making it a factual addition. The panic was caused by inaccessible SEP registers, with locationd as the panicked task. A hypothesis is that this crash may align with MyViettel-linked monitoring behavior.
At 20:27:26 on June 7, 2025, iPhone12 mini-1 experienced a new bug_type=210 crash. Unlike earlier logs, it is not a duplicate, but a separate incident with a unique incident_id—hence a factual new entry. The panicString shows “SEP monitor error: INACCESSIBLE SEP REGISTERS…”, pointing to a Secure Enclave Processor register access failure. The panicked task was pid 74 locationd, Apple’s location service. This event occurred alongside other bug_type clusters and MyViettel-related anchor windows, making it plausible—though still a hypothesis—that the crash was induced as part of coordinated monitoring or remote management actions. While the overall trend remains unchanged, this adds weight to the evidence and was appended to both the differential tables and the human impact mapping.
