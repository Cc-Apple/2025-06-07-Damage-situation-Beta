2025-06-06 — Established Facts: This repo preserves chain-of-custody (SHA-256, UTC+7) and a dedicated space for June-06 artifacts; no event for 06-06 is confirmed in this note. Hypotheses: By analogy with 2025-06-07, a MyViettel-anchored co-occurrence window may exist on 06-06; same-second clusters (score=3) are the first verification target.
2025-06-06 — Consolidated Note.
Established Facts: (1) The repository maintains an auditable chain-of-custody (SHA-256 for source and derived files) with timestamps normalized to UTC+7. (2) A dedicated directory exists for 2025-06-06 to store artifacts, CSVs, and digest files; these slots are prepared for publication on GitHub. (3) Methods to be applied on 06-06 are pre-defined: 40-step text FUKABORI, category keyword scan, time-window joins (same-second/±60s/±5m), and human-impact mapping. Hypotheses (explicit): (A) Given the 2025-06-07 pattern, 06-06 may also contain a MyViettel-anchored co-occurrence; (B) if present, same-second clusters (time_score=3) should form the primary signal, with ±5-minute neighbors as supporting context; (C) Flame-related hits (Microsoft/Meta/Telco) could appear sparsely and must be labeled as hypotheses until confirmed by log refs and hashes. Next Actions: publish 06-06 artifacts to the prepared folder; run the standard pipeline; mark every statement as Established Fact only when backed by file path + SHA-256 + timestamp.
